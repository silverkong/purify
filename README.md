## Introduction
This is a high level description of the project. Describe what the project is for, what it is doing and which problem it solves. This should not be long, usually 2-3 lines is good, keep it short and precise.

Highlight some features:
- Consectetur adipiscing elit in efficitur.
- Congue ac nunc nec, bibendum hendrerit mi.
- Donec sodales ligula ac dolor vehicula, at venenatis nulla feugiat.

Adding an illustration of the architecture can quickly explain how the project is built, and how it works.

## Usage
Most projects have a frontend, so link to the canister and provide a brief getting-started instruction. If the project has a backend that may be called without a frontend, which is typically the case for developer libraries, tooling, infrastructure etc., then provide some basic examples of how to use it. 

### Example 1
Usage examples can be canister calls:

```bash
$ dfx canister call mycanister myfunc '("abc")'
```

### Example 2
If the project is added as a separate canister, show how to access the functions.

```javascript
import MyFunc  "mo:myproj/MyFunc";  

private let myFunc = MyFunc.MyFunc();

...

let value = myFunc("abc");

...
```

## Documentation
Further documentation can exist in the README file if the project only contains a few functions. It can also be located elsewhere, if it is extensive, if this is the case, link to it.  

## Testing
Test instructions, and test scripts, for this project:

```bash
$ run test
```

Test specific feature:

```bash
$ run test 1
```
